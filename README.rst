The optical depth integral
==========================

We are asking, 'What is the contribution from each slice?'.
That is, with a source at given :math:`z_s`, what is the contribution from each slice at :math:`z_l` due to mass :math:`M`?
The contribution is directly related to the cross-section, which is itself a function of the relative distances between the pbserver, source, and lens.

.. math::
  
  \frac{d_A(z_l,z_s)}{d_A(z_l)d_A(z_s)}
